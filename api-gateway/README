# API Gateway 

We are implementing an API gateway pattern to our project. 

This is the single entry point for all clients. The API gateway handles the requests.
At the moment we have in this layer only the authentication using JWT then the requests are simply proxied/routed to the appropriate service.

## To-do

* Add cache handling
